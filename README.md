A simple plugin to show surface properties on a part in Roblox Studio.

**The code is a bit of a mess, but at least I am transparent about it.**
*I might rescript the plugin for better preformance and repetitive code.*

## Plugin Usage

This is a basic guide on how to use the plugin.

* Download the plugin with the link shown above.
* Open up Studio and select the part(s) you want the surface properties to be show on.
* Go to the top bar, press Plugins > X7legendary's Plugins > Show Surface Type
* Make sure you are still selecting the part(s), and press the plugin button. It should have a text of `Show Surface Type` and an icon as a part.
* After that, you will see a message in the output saying that the surface properties had been shown for the part(s) and a thank you for using the plugin text.

## Warning
I am **not** responsible if the plugin crashes Studio. It will **only** crash if you select a large number of parts. Keep that in mind!
