# ShowSurfaceType
A simple plugin to show surface properties on a part in Roblox Studio.

**The code is a bit of a mess, but at least I am transparent about it.**
*I might rescript the plugin for better preformance and repetitive code.*
I probably won't be updating this plugin often (or ever), but if you want to contribute make a PR and I'll check it out.

## Plugin Usage

This is a basic guide on how to use the plugin.

1. Download the plugin with the link shown above.
2. Open up Studio and select the part(s) you want the surface properties to be show on
3. Go to the top bar, press Plugins > X7legendary's Plugins > Show Surface Type
4. Make sure you are still selecting the part(s), and press the plugin button. It should have a text of `Show Surface Type` and an icon as a part
5. After that, you will see a message in the output saying that the surface properties had been shown for the part(s) and a thank you for using the plugin text

## Warning
I am **not** responsible if the plugin crashes Studio. It will **only** crash if you select a large number of parts. Keep that in mind!
